# üëã Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me  
Hi, I‚Äôm **Max** ‚Äî a Machine Learning Engineer and MSc candidate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Birmingham. My journey into AI started with a fascination for mathematics, which naturally evolved into a passion for creating intelligent systems that learn and adapt. I enjoy combining technical rigour with creativity to build impactful solutions to real-world problems, always striving to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in machine learning.

I‚Äôm deeply invested in understanding the *why* behind every algorithm and optimising solutions for performance, scalability, and elegance. Whether it‚Äôs fine-tuning large language models or designing custom architectures, I love diving deep into the technical details that make machine learning models work.

## üåü Current Focus  

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been working on recently:

### 1. **CIFAR-100 Image Classification Project**  
- **Overview**: Designed a modular ResNet-based training pipeline for CIFAR-100 image classification.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Supports advanced data augmentations, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.  
  - Integrated TensorBoard logging for metrics tracking.  
  - Includes a GUI and FastAPI-based web app for deployment.  

### 2. **Custom GPT-2 Implementation (124M Parameters)**  
- **Overview**: Built a scaled-down version of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-2 with over 124M parameters for text generation.  
- **Key Contributions**:  
  - Trained on distributed cloud GPUs.  
  - Implemented efficient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to optimise performance.  
  - Integrated Hellaswag dataset for model evaluation and perplexity benchmarking.  

### 3. **AI-Powered APIs for Seamless Deployment**  
- **Overview**: Developing APIs to democratise access to my models.  
- **Projects**:  
  - Created an API for serving predictions from the CIFAR-100 classification model.  
  - Designed a frontend GUI for real-time image uploads and class predictions.  
  - Used FastAPI for backend logic and model hosting.  

### 4. **Experimentation in Model Optimisation**  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Quantisation-aware training to reduce model size.  
  - Gradient clipping and adaptive schedulers for stable training.  
  - Distributed training strategies for scaling experiments.  

I‚Äôm driven by the challenge of turning theoretical machine learning concepts into real-world applications. Whether it‚Äôs building models from scratch or fine-tuning massive architectures, I‚Äôm constantly exploring new ways to push the limits of AI.
